# **📢 MLEnd Deception Dataset Mini Project**

## **🎯 Objective**
The goal of this project is to develop a **binary classification machine learning model** that determines whether a given narrated story is **truthful or deceptive**. The dataset used, the **MLEnd Deception Dataset**, consists of labeled audio recordings where individuals recount personal experiences—either real or fabricated.

---

## **📂 Dataset Overview**
The dataset includes **100 labeled samples**, each containing:

- **Language:** English or a native language  
- **Story Type:** True or Deceptive  
- **Recordings per Student:**  
  - **4 stories in English** (2 truthful, 2 deceptive)  
  - **2 stories in a native language** (1 truthful, 1 deceptive)  

Each story is a spoken narrative that falls into one of these categories.

## **🛠️ Project Workflow**
This project involves the following key steps:

### 🔍 Data Exploration & Preprocessing
- Understanding the structure of the dataset  
- Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis  

### 🎙️ Feature Extraction from Audio Files
- Extracting relevant **acoustic and linguistic** features  
- Transforming raw audio recordings into a format suitable for model training  

### 🤖 Model Development & Evaluation
- Training a **machine learning classifier**  
- Evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics  

### 🧪 Testing on Unseen Data
- Applying the trained model to **new, unseen samples**  
- Measuring predictive performance  

---

## **🏆 Final Goal**
By completing this project, we aim to build a **robust deception detection model** that can be used to classify new storytelling samples from the dataset.
